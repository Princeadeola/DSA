A stable sort algorithm preserves the relative ordering of duplicate
elements

STABLE SORT
Unsorted : 5, 9 , 3, 9, 8, 4
Sorted: 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 9   =>(first appeared 9 in unsorted will also appear first when sorted
                              before the other will appear, which means the order of appearance
                              of duplicate elements remains the same example bubble sort
                              because we can only swap position of bubble sort when the first
                              element is greater than the next and if there are the same then
                              we don't swap)

AND

Unstable sort algorithm is the opposite of the stable sort
