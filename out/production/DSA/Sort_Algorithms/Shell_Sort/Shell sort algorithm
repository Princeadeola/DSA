Shell sort algorithm like Insertion sort only that it is called shell sort because
it wil first run through the array by comparing the element with 3 position element
and ensure that the first comparison in sorted and with that process we will end up
disorganizing the arrays and storing the first sorted array at the right position. which kind of
enhances the new unsorted arrays

Example: 20 35 -15 7 55 1 -22
         -22 35 -15 7 55 1 20 (-> shell sort)
         {-> After the the shell sort then the insertion sort is carried out on the new
          arrangement which is now -22 35 -15 7 55 1 20}

        ANS:
Shell - Insertion sorted : -22 -15 1 7 20 35 55

Note about Insertion sort:
1. It is an in-place algorithm : It does not use any extra memory
2. It is difficult to nail down the time complexity because it will depend on the
   gap. Worst case O(n^2), but it can perform much better than that
3. It does not require much as insertion sort so it usually perform better
4. Unstable algorithm

NOTE: You can also improve bubble sort with shell sort and the same kind of idea is applied
